00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.720
It's Saturday night somewhere, so make

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.200
some noise for Mega Party. Get ready for

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.040
a nailbiting competition. We're

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.440
minifigures, Dad. We don't have nails.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.680
It's an action-packed contest to collect

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.720
the most golden bricks. But will you be

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.680
helped by friendly Krakens or hindered

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.199
by evil monsters or lightly toasted by a

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.439
flying lizard with wings? That's a

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.160
dragon,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.640
Ted. What about our amazing mini games,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.040
Dad? We've got more of them than you can

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.960
count. More than 10. It's actually more

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.920
like 60. Wo, that's a lot.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.360
With surprises around every corner,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.879
anything can happen. Anything? Anything?

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.239
Anything? Yes, anything. Okay, but

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.719
certainly not a giant crab. A mythical

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.440
king cobra or Master Woo smashing a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.440
crate. Those were literally just on

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.640
screen. Wow. We've got all that and more

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.280
in Lego

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.640
[Applause]

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.910
party. That is looking mighty tasty.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.090
